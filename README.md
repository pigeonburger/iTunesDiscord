This is an application that lets you have a personalized Discord status based on what you're listening to on iTunes.

The status will show the song name, artist and the amount of time left in the song. Additionally, an image with a "play" or "paused" button will be shown in case the track is playing or paused.

# Features:
- No extra login required (just have Discord open on your PC)
- Fairly small program (12MB `.exe` file)
- Runs in the background; has no UI so it won't annoy you or clog up the taskbar.

# Requirements:
- Windows (tested on Windows 10, may work on others)
- [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/) version 4.7 or higher and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/download) applications.
- Must be logged into the Discord app.

# Usage:
- [Download the latest version](https://github.com/pigeonburger/iTunesDiscord/releases/latest) of the application.
- Make sure Discord is open (app will return an error if not open)
- Double click the `exe` you just downloaded.
- iTunes will open, you can start playing music and watch it display on your Discord profile!
